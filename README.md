# Pong-Game
Pong is one of the most famous arcade games, simulating table tennis. Each player controls a paddle in the game by dragging it vertically across the screenâ€™s left or right side. Players use their paddles to strike back and forth on the ball. I have created this game using object-oriented programming, inheritance concepts and used python modules such as turtle, time and random.
